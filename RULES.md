# How To Play

## Rules

### Starting play

Any player may initiate a sweepstakes by sending the Croupier XLM, amount being 0.01XLM or greater, within a Keybase channel that the Croupier is a member of.  e.g. `+0.01XLM@croupier`.

### Powerups

If one enters the sweepstakes three times in a row, via bet above the minimum blinds, without any other participant or newcomer entering the round, then a powerup will be randomly awarded.  The initial blind is 0.01XLM and then 10 minutes in, and every 5 minutes thereafter, blinds are doubled.

‚ò¢Ô∏è: Go nuclear and play everyone's powerups in the order they were received

üçß: For the next 10 seconds, powerups and bets are worthless and increase your position by 1

üï∫: o/\` It's the final countdown!  Reset the clock to 1 minute

üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà: Level the playing field and reset everybody's positions to 1

üëØ: Put it to a vote: who does the group like more, you or the pot leader?  If the pot leader wins, your position is reduced to 1.  If you win, you and the pot leader swap position sizes!

‚åõ: Cut the remaining time in half

‚è≥: Double the remaining time

üî´: Reduce the pot leader's position size to 1

üó°: Your position size has an even chance of doubling/halving

### No purchase necessary

By reacting, within Keybase, to one of Croupier‚Äôs messages regarding an individual round, with one of the following reactions, Croupier will grant a complimentary entry, of position size 1:

[`:smile:`, `:smiley:`, `:raising_hand:`, `:man-raising-hand:`, `:woman-raising-hand:`, `:thumbsup:`, `:clap:`, `:man-tipping-hand:`, `:woman-tipping-hand:`, `:sparkles:`, `:zany_face:`, `:+1:`]

### How someone wins

When a game of Croupier begins, a 60 second countdown clock begins.  Whenever a new bet is added to the pot, there is a clock adjustment.  If the time remaining is less than 30 seconds, the clock is reset to 60 seconds.  If more than 30 seconds remain, 10 seconds are added to the clock.  The clock may be adjusted through the use of powerups as well.

When there are 0 seconds left on the clock, no more bets are accepted.

Free entries grant additional position size of 1; paid entries grant additional position size of bet size divided by 0.01 (e.g. 100 position for a 1 XLM bet).  Position sizes may also be affected by use or other participants‚Äô use of powerups.

Participants are then assigned a range of numbers in accordance to their position size.  A random number, between 1 and the cumulative total of positions, is then publicly generated through Keybase‚Äôs flip functionality.  The participant whose range contains said random number is then awarded the pot total less any transaction fees.

### Betting on behalf of someone else

Anyone may enter a round on behalf of any other Keybase identity using this betting format:
`+0.01XLM@croupier for:keybaseusername`.

### Maximum Pot Size

Pot sizes are limited to 20,000 XLM.  The reason for this is to comply with legislation that limits sweepstakes sizes as well as legislation that requires certain sweepstakes prizes to be bonded.

### Viewing Round Details and Historical Results

There is not yet an API for this but we plan to make one available in the future.  For now, please direct inquiries regarding round histories to team@codefor.cash.
